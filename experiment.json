    "description": "Extension of the BART. In this task subjects 'fish' in rounds trying to accumulate as much money as possible. When they 'fish' if they catch a red fish, they earn .05 cents. However, if they catch a blue fish they lose all the money earned on that round. They are able to stop any round at any time to collect that round's earnings into their 'tournament bank'. There is one blue fish and many red fish. The subjects complete 4 tournaments of 30 rounds each. The tournaments differ in their weather condition: Sunny (subjects can see/know how many red/blue fish are in the pond) and cloudy (subjects cannot see the fish) and release law: catch N Keep (probability of catching a red fish goes down as they are taken out of the pond) and catch N Release (probability stays constant).",
